# This is a workflow trigger practice code

Deliberately created an issue in `index.py`. I was supposed to return the total from the function
but deliberately returned the `iterable` instead. I pushed the code to GitHub, so that I can raise
an `issue` on it and then simulate a workflow with an `issue` trigger.
